# Happlet Toddler Games

Games for Toddlers (kids age 2-5) built on the [Happlets GTK+
Library]( https://github.com/RaminHAL9001/happlets-lib-gtk ).

### What this game is not:

*   a fully completed, batteries included product that resembles any
    toys or games made by the Disney corporation. Not even close.

*   a game that runs in the browser. No, it requirs Gtk+, which
    works best on Linux, but can be made to work on Windows and
    Mac OS as well

*   a game with lots of cute assets like sounds and animation. No,
    you the parent/admin must supply and configure your own
    assets.

*   a game that safely prevents kids from accidentally deleting your
    files. Players can click out of the game window and start
    pressing random keys; always supervise young children.

Most of these games are designed to present graphics and sound
which can be configured by modifying the configuration files,
however without config files the games won't work well, if at
all. It is up to you to retrieve your own assets for this game.

It is best to run this program with the window maximized to occupy
the whole screen, to reduce the odds of clicks and key-presses
outside of the window result in the game being obscured.

Most of these games play sound and display images or simple
animations in response to winning gameplay, again which sounds and
images are displayed must be configured by the parent/admin.

### Game ideas that I want to work on

1.  __Type the Alphabet__: in which players get a randomly
    selected audio/visual reward for pressing the correct next key
    in the sequence.

2.  __Colorful ASCII Art__: in which players draw pictures with
    ASCII and can change the forecolor/backcolor of each
    character. Simple animations are possible.

3.  __Musical Instrument__: in which players assign sound effects
    to letters on the keyboard and can play the sound effects by
    pressing keys.

4.  __Memory and Matching__: select matching pairs of cards in a
    grid.

5.  __Virtual Pet__: create a home for your virtual pet, feed it
    and play with it every day, if you don't it will run away.

6.  __Flashcard Wizard__: explore a procedurally generated world,
    learn to defend yourself and attack enemies by answering
    flashcard questions (e.g. arithmetic, spelling), gather
    treasure, trade for supplies, the more flashcards you answer
    correctly, the more you improve your magic skills.
